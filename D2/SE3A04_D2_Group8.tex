\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This document provides a high-level overview of the RideRecon car identification system architecture, including high-level design considerations of the system and design consideration for various subsystems. This document is intended for internal RideRecon stakeholders, including but not limited to, project managers, developers, domain experts, and RideRecon team members/investors. \\

\noindent Note that RideRecon Deliverable 1 should be read before Deliverable 2, and technical knowledge may be beneficial in better understanding this document's contents.

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
The RideRecon system is designed to identify vehicles based on both text and image inputs, leveraging multiple expert modules (such as a reverse image search engine, a text-based LLM, and trained ML models). To integrate these diverse experts effectively, RideRecon follows a blackboard architecture. In this approach, all relevant data—user inputs, partial identifications, and expert findings—are posted to a central “blackboard.” Each expert module reads from this shared repository, processes the data according to its specialization, and writes back its results. This iterative process continues until a consensus or a conflict resolution mechanism determines the final identification outcome.\\

\noindent A blackboard architecture is well-suited to RideRecon because it supports concurrent data processing among the different expert modules, each of which may require varying amounts of time or resources. It also simplifies the system’s ability to integrate new expert modules in the future—such as additional AI models or external APIs—by giving them the same shared data repository to read from and write to. This design ensures that updates or new insights posted by one expert can immediately inform the decision-making of others, resulting in a flexible, extensible platform for complex vehicle identification tasks.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of your application. Your overall architecture should show the division of the system into subsystems with high cohesion and low coupling.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
The main architecture used in RideRecon is the Blackboard architecture. The Blackboard architecture style has several subsystems that are involved, as it utilizes the knowledge of up to four different agents, including Vertex AI Image, Google Reverse Image Search (RIS), text-based large-language model (LLM) and an internally trained machine learning (ML) program. These resources are These resources are integrated into the architecture through a Repository style so that each subsystem agent creates a hybrid architecture with both the Blackboard and Repository style.\\

\noindent The following subsystems that have been included in the architecture diagram have been defined below:\\

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|p{3.5cm}|}
	\hline
	Subsystem & Purpose & Architectural Style \\
	\hline
	Account Management & Create, access, update, recover and authenticate account. & Repository \\
	\hline
	Collection Management & Create, view and edit a car collection. & Repository \\
	\hline
	Input Management & Identify a car through text or image and add to a collection afterwards (if desired). & Blackboard with each agent using Repository \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}\\


\noindent Subsystem relationships and further explanation of their architecture are defined in Section 3.2 of this document.

\noindent In addition, there are three databases, each utilized by the different subsystems. The G8M stores all relevant information for the internally trained ML agent. The account database and car collection database, respectively, store all account details and all relevant information required to create specific car collections.\\

\noindent As stated above, the architecture incorporates both Blackboard and Repository styles, with the overall architecture style being recognized as Blackboard as it is most significant for completing the main program functionality, which is car identification. The Blackboard style was chosen due to its ability to utilize many different domain-specific knowledge sources (i.e., the four different agents specified above) that can collaborate together while solving a complex problem\\

\noindent The nature of the Blackboard architecture allows the system to determine nondeterministic solutions, which is helpful for our program as we recognize that identification will always be bound by the limitations of the data covered by the specified agents. The ability of the Blackboard architecture to have different agents working in parallel allows our system to support identification through both image and text simultaneously, which is important for comprehensive identification. Additionally, using a Blackboard architecture style allows easy scalability through updating existing knowledge sources and adding new knowledge sources. This is beneficial to our system as the expected app maintenance will require modifications to the knowledge sources in the event that their knowledge limitations are no longer acceptable.\\

\noindent The Repository architecture is also incorporated for each knowledge source in the Blackboard method as it allows multiple software component clients to access different aspects of large, complex information systems. In this case, the agents of the blackboard system are considered the clients that can request the necessary information to complete their partial solutions. This is beneficial for the system as it ensures that the agents are able to access the relevant data stores that they need, even if another agent is simultaneously accessing other information from the data store. This also allows multiple users to operate the system at the same time, as the information system is able to be accessible to multiple instances of agents who are looking to identify different cars. Furthermore, if more agents are added to the Blackboard architecture, the Repository style ensures each new knowledge source will be able to easily access the necessary data store. The Repository style can easily integrate additional protection measures, as it supports data integrity with an easy way to back up and restore information. Additionally, by also integrating the Repository style in Account and Collection Management subsystems, it ensures that the system is easily able to accommodate multiple users at the same time.\\

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/system_architecture.png}
\textbf{Figure 2.} System Architecture.\\
\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{Why Batch Sequential architecture was not used:} Due to its rigid and sequential style of architecture, it lacks the real-time, iterative, and dynamic collaboration approach that is useful to solve complex problems such as identification. It also is unable to handle real-time updates due to its reliance on batched data sets, which is unsuitable as the system should be able to continuously adapt to new information in order to provide the best solution given all information provided.\\

\noindent \textbf{Why Pipe and Filter architecture was not used:} Similarly, to Batch Sequential architecture, the rigid nature of having specific defined processing steps in which it handles data makes it unsuitable for the dynamic collaboration required during an identification process.\\

\noindent \textbf{Why Process-Control architecture was not used:} This architecture is more rigid and better suited for a system with precise, well-defined target points in specific data that help determine fixed-logic decisions. Since identification involves uncertainty and dynamic reasoning, this makes it unideal for an architecture that relies on fixed rules and thresholds that shape the decision-making process.\\

% End SubSection

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
The RideRecon system is divided into several key subsystems, each with a distinct role that contributes to the overall vehicle identification process. At its core, RideRecon employs a hybrid architecture that combines a blackboard approach—enabling multiple expert modules to collaboratively process inputs—with a repository-style design that robustly manages and stores data. This design not only ensures accurate vehicle identification but also supports continuous improvement through systematic data management.\\

\noindent The Input Management Subsystem is responsible for capturing and preprocessing user inputs, including both text and image data. It ensures that all input data is correctly formatted and validated before being fed into the core processing units. The Identification Subsystem acts as the central processing hub where diverse expert modules—such as the Vertex AI Image Model, Reverse Image Search, a specialized text-based LLM, and an internally trained ML model—post their analyses to a shared blackboard, collaboratively resolving any conflicts to produce a final identification. The Data Management Subsystem leverages repository principles to securely store both raw user inputs and processed outputs, which supports future retraining, auditing, and model improvement. Finally, the Account Management Subsystem handles user authentication and profile management, ensuring personalized interactions and maintaining a comprehensive record of user engagements. Together, these interconnected subsystems create a robust and scalable platform tailored to the challenges of dynamic, real-world vehicle identification.
